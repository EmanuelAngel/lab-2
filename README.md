## Recommendations

- **Node.js** Version used in the project: v20.14. [Recommended LTS Version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer)

## Description

- Sign up, log in, and log out.
- Create, list, edit, activate, and deactivate patients.
- Create, list, edit, activate, and deactivate professionals (doctors).
- Create, list, edit, activate, and deactivate specialties.
- List schedules.
- Assign an appointment to a patient in an available time slot of a schedule.

## Details

- A patient can have none or multiple health insurance plans.
- A professional can have one or more specialties.
- Each schedule corresponds to a registration in a professional's specialty.
- Schedules can include appointments on different days, both morning and afternoon.
- Schedule time slots can be fragmented, allowing unavailable time slots on the same day.
- Secure access to the application based on user roles (e.g., admin, professional, patient).

## Instructions to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmanuelAngel/lab-2.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned folder:

```bash
cd lab-2
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm|yarn|pnpm install
```

4. Download the database copy and import it into a MySQL manager.

5. Create a `.env` file and modify the environment variables according to your setup:

```bash
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 3001
DB_HOST = localhost
DB_USER = root
DB_PORT = 3306
DB_PASS =
DB_NAME = mydb
DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT = 10
JWT_SECRET = secret_very_secret
JWT_EXPIRES = 1h
```

6. Start the server:

```bash
npm|yarn|pnpm run dev
```

## Future Scalability

This project has been designed and architected with scalability in mind, ready to integrate future functionalities such as:

- Management of overbooked appointments.
- Additional appointment states (canceled, rescheduled, etc.).
- Handling photocopies of ID documents.
- Advanced administration panel.

The modular structure of the project facilitates the incorporation of these and other features while maintaining organized and maintainable code.
